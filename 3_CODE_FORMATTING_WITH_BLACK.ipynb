But a tab character, which is rendered as a string value containing an escape character, or '\\t', is more ambiguous. Tabs often, but not always, render as a variable amount of spacing so the following text begins at the next tab stop. The tab stop are positioned every eight spaces across the width of a text file. You can see this variation in the following interactive shell example, which first separates words with space characters and then with tab characters:"
