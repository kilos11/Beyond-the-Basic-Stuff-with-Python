The path specifies the location of a file on the computer. For example, a file on my Windows 10 laptop has the filename project.docx in the path ##C:\\Users\\Al\\Documents. The part of the filename after the last period is the file’s extension and tells you a file’s type. The filename project.docx is a Word document, and Users, Al, and Documents all refer to folders (also called directories). Folders can contain files and other folders. For example, project.docx is in the Documents folder, which is in the Al folder,\n",

You might also hear it called the command line interface (CLI, which rhymes with “fly”), command prompt, terminal, shell, or console. It provides an alternative to a graphical user interface (GUI, pronounced “gooey”), which allows the user to interact with the computer through more than just a text-based interface. A GUI presents visual information to a user to guide them through tasks more easily than the command line does. Most computer users treat the command line as an advanced feature and never touch it. Part of the intimidation factor is due to the complete lack of hints of how to use it; although a GUI might display a button showing you where to click, a blank terminal window doesn’t remind you what to type.\n",

This lends them to automation better, because you can combine multiple specific commands into scripts to perform sophisticated operations.\n",

Linux uses Bash by default, whereas macOS uses the similar Zsh or Z shell in Catalina and later versions. Due to its different development history, Windows uses a shell named Command Prompt.
