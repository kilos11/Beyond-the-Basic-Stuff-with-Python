For example, if you’re handling a signup form that asks users to enter their password twice to prevent typos, you might store those password strings in variables named password1 and password2. These numeric suffixes aren’t good descriptions of what the variables contain or the differences between them. They also don’t indicate how many of these variables there are: is there a password3 or a password4 as well? Try to create distinct names rather than lazily adding numeric suffixes.
