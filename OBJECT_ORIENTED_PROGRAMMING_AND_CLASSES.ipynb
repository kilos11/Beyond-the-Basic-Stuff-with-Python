You can call lower() on a string, as in 'Hello'.lower(), but you can’t call it on a list, such as ['dog', 'cat'].lower(). Also, notice that methods come after the object: the correct code is 'Hello'.lower(), not lower('Hello'). Unlike a method like lower(), a function like len() is not associated with a single data type; you can pass strings, lists, dictionaries, and many other types of objects to len().\n",

        "##As you saw in the previous section, we create objects by calling the class name as a function. This function is referred to as a constructor function (or constructor, or abbreviated as ctor, pronounced “see-tore”) because it constructs a new object. We also say the constructor instantiates a new instance of the class.\n",

But the __init__() method has four parameters: self, galleons, sickles, and knuts. The reason is that all methods have a first parameter named self. When a method is called on an object, the object is automatically passed in for the self parameter. The rest of the arguments are assigned to parameters normally. If you see an error message, such as TypeError: __init__() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given, you’ve probably forgotten to add the self parameter to the method’s def statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "##You don’t have to name a method’s first parameter self; you can name it anything. But using self is conventional, and choosing a different name will make your code less readable to other Python programmers. When you’re reading code, the presence of self as the first parameter is the quickest way you can distinguish methods from functions. Similarly, if your method’s code never needs to use the self parameter, it’s a sign that your method should probably just be a function.\n",

        "##The 2, 5, and 99 arguments of WizCoin(2, 5, 99) aren’t automatically assigned to the new object’s attributes; we need the three assignment statements in __init__() to do this. Often, the __init__() parameters are named the same as the attributes, but the presence of self in self.galleons indicates that it’s an attribute of the object, whereas galleons is a parameter. This storing of the constructor’s arguments in the object’s attributes is a common task for a class’s __init__() method. The datetime.date() call in the previous section did a similar task except the three arguments we passed were for the newly created date object’s year, month, and day attributes.\n",
