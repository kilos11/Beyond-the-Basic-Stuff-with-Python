The programmer doesn’t need to figure out how many bytes of memory to request because Python manages this automatically. Python’s garbage collector will free the local variables when the function call returns to make that memory available for other data. Garbage collection makes programming much easier and less bug-prone."

        "#**Script vs. Program, ScriptingLanguage vs. Programming Language**#\n",
        "##The differences between a script and a program, or even a scripting language and a programming language, are vague and arbitrary. It’s fair to say that all scripts are programs and all scripting languages are programming languages. But scripting languages are sometimes regarded as easier or “not real” programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "##One way to distinguish scripts from programs is by how the code executes. Scripts written in scripting languages are interpreted directly from the source code, whereas programs written in programming languages are compiled into binaries. But Python is commonly thought of as a scripting language, even though there is a compilation step to bytecode when a Python program is run. Meanwhile, Java isn’t commonly thought of as a scripting language, even though it produces bytecode instead of machine code binaries, just like Python. Technically, languages aren’t compiled or interpreted; rather, there are compiler or interpreter implementations of a language, and it’s possible to create a compiler or interpreter for any language.\n",
        "\n",
        "##The differences can be argued but ultimately aren’t very important. Scripting languages aren’t necessarily less powerful, nor are compiled programming languages more difficult to work with."
